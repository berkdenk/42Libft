# Libft - 42 School Project

Libft is a foundational project at 42 that involves creating a custom C library from scratch. This project aims to strengthen your understanding of the C language by re-implementing essential standard library functions and adding utility functions commonly used in programming.

## 🚀 Purpose
The main goals of the `libft` project are:
- To learn and implement fundamental C standard library functions.
- To understand memory management, string manipulation, and algorithm basics.
- To write clean and structured code while following the 42 coding norms.

## ✨ Features
Libft provides implementations for:
1. **Libc Functions**: Re-implementations of standard C library functions like `memset`, `strlen`, `strcpy`, etc.
2. **Additional Functions**: Utility functions such as `ft_itoa`, `ft_split`, and `ft_strjoin`.
3. **Bonus Features**: Linked list manipulation functions for advanced use cases.

## 🔧 Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berkdenk/42Libft.git
   cd 42Libft

    Compile the library:

make

Include the library in your project:

    Add libft.a to your project.
    Include the header file libft.h in your source files:

    #include "libft.h"

Clean up compiled files:

    make clean      # Removes object files
    make fclean     # Removes object files and the library file
    make re         # Recompiles everything

📜 Norm Compliance

All functions and files in this project adhere to the 42 Norm, ensuring consistency and code quality.
🛠️ Requirements

    Compiler: GCC
    Flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror
    Makefile: Provides all, clean, fclean, and re rules.

🧪 Testing

To test the library:

    Use your own test cases.
    Optionally, integrate a community-provided tester like 42Tester.
